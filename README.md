# rware


Poc demo rware for my curriculum's educational purposes in cpp ; imports a key, loops recursively through all the files of some specific directories while multi-threading, encrypts those, and pops a GUI before setting itself in the regkeys for persistence.
No evasion or obfuscation on purpose.
